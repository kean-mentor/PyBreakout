Plans:
- ball & block collision detection -> In progress
- blocks with multiple "lives"
- game over detection
- score and lives
- switch level if all block erased
- powerups

Issues:
- Improvement: check paddle side collision
- Bug: move ball to outside of the object if overlapping is occures during collision

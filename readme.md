Future improvements:

-   Switch level if all blocks are erased
-   Add unbreakeable blocks
-   Powerups

Known issues:

-   Improvement: check paddle side collision
-   Bug: move ball to outside of the object if overlapping is occures during collision <- handled for blocks, also need to handle for windows border and paddle

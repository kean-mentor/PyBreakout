Plans:
- sounds
- game over detection
- score and lives
- switch level if all block erased
- add unbreakeable blocks
- powerups

Issues:
- Improvement: check paddle side collision
- Bug: move ball to outside of the object if overlapping is occures during collision <-- handled for blocks, also need to handle for windows border and paddle
